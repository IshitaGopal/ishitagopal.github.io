Hi! I am a data scientist and computational social scientist.>>

I use data science to answer questions around human communication and behavior broadly. I focus on the applications of machine learning, causal inference, and network analysis to extract insights from diverse and complex data sources, including text, networks, and, more recently, audio data. My academic research explores the dynamics of political communication on digital platforms, peer effects in political networks, cross state diffusion of public policies and more broadly, the applications of data scinece tools for political research. This work has been published in peer-reviewed journals and was partially funded by Princeton.

Currently, I am a Postdoctoral fellow at the [Transdisciplinary Institute in Applied Data Sciences at Washington University in St Louis](https://triads.wustl.edu/). I hold a dual title Ph.D. in Social Data Analytics and Political Science from Pennsylvania State University, an M.Sc. in Economics from the Univesity of Warwick and a B.A. in Economics from Miranda House, University of Delhi. During my Ph.D. I was a Data Science intern at [Aware](https://www.awarehq.com/), where I developed machine learning models to detect sensitive data in digital workplaces. Before starting my Ph.D., I worked as an economist at [TERI](https://www.teriin.org/), an Energy & Environment thinktank.


<!--- I use data science to study . Specifically, I utilize large-scale data from social platforms to model interactions in digital spaces and their impact on internet censorship, repression, and public policy diffusion. I have expertise in the applications of natural language processing, network analysis, and causal inference. -->
