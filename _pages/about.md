Hi!

I am a data scientist currently working at the [Transdisciplinary Institute in Applied Data Sciences at Washington University in St Louis](https://triads.wustl.edu/). I develop and employ computational methods - NLP, machine and deep learning, network analysis and experiments - to analyze communication dynamics, information diffusion, political media and behavior on social media platforms. I enjoy working on the applications of data science and am currently building deep learning models to identify attack advertising on YouTube. My work has been published in peer-reviewed journals and I also create tutorials on a variety of data science topics. 

I completed my PhD in Social Data Analytics and Political Science from Pennsylvania State University, an MSc in Economics from the Univesity of Warwick and a BA in Economics from Miranda House, University of Delhi. I was also a Data Science intern at [Aware](https://www.awarehq.com/). Before getting my PhD, I worked as an economist at [TERI](https://www.teriin.org/), an Energy & Environment think tank.

Currently, I am a Postdoctoral fellow at the [Transdisciplinary Institute in Applied Data Sciences at Washington University in St Louis](https://triads.wustl.edu/). I hold a dual title Ph.D. in Social Data Analytics and Political Science from Pennsylvania State University, an M.Sc. in Economics from the Univesity of Warwick and a B.A. in Economics from Miranda House, University of Delhi.  During my Ph.D. I was a Data Science intern at [Aware](https://www.awarehq.com/), where I developed machine learning models to detect sensitive data in digital workplaces. Before starting my Ph.D., I worked as an economist at [TERI](https://www.teriin.org/), an Energy & Environment thinktank. -->


<!--- I use data science to study . Specifically, I utilize large-scale data from social platforms to model interactions in digital spaces and their impact on internet censorship, repression, and public policy diffusion. I have expertise in the applications of natural language processing, network analysis, and causal inference. -->
