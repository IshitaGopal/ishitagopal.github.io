Hi!

I am a data scientist currently working at the [Transdisciplinary Institute in Applied Data Sciences at Washington University in St Louis](https://triads.wustl.edu/).

I develop and apply advanced methods in data science to analyze communication dynamics, diffusion of information, political media and behavior on social media platforms. I am particularly interested in developing machine/deep learning models to extract information from 'messy data' in text, audio and network formats. You can find my papers on these topics in the Research section. I also enjoy making tutorials on a these topics. (This work has been published in peer-reviewed journals and was partially funded by Princeton.)

I hold a dual title Ph.D. in Social Data Analytics and Political Science from Pennsylvania State University, an M.Sc. in Economics from the Univesity of Warwick and a B.A. in Economics from Miranda House, University of Delhi. I was also a Data Science intern at [Aware](https://www.awarehq.com/), where I developed machine learning models to detect sensitive data in digital workplaces. Before starting my Ph.D., I worked as an economist at [TERI](https://www.teriin.org/), an Energy & Environment think tank.

<!--- I use data science to study . Specifically, I utilize large-scale data from social platforms to model interactions in digital spaces and their impact on internet censorship, repression, and public policy diffusion. I have expertise in the applications of natural language processing, network analysis, and causal inference. -->
