Hi>>

<!--- I use data science to study . Specifically, I utilize large-scale data from social platforms to model interactions in digital spaces and their impact on internet censorship, repression, and public policy diffusion. I have expertise in the applications of natural language processing, network analysis, and causal inference. -->
